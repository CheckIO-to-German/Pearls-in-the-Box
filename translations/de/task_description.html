    To start the game, they put several black and white pearls in one of the boxes.
    Each robots have <strong>Nth</strong> moves, then initial set are restored for a next player.
    For each move, the robot take a pearl out of the box and put one of the opposite color back.
    The winner is the one who pulls the white pearl on the <strong>Nth</strong> step (or +1 point if they play many parties).
</p>

<p>
    Our robots don't like indeterminacy and want to know the probability of a white pearl on the Nth step.
    The probability is a value between 0 (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
    The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two digits precision (&plusmn;0.01).
</p>

<p>
    You are given a start set of pearls as a string that contains "b" (black) and "w" (white) and the number of the step
    (N).
    The order of the pearls does not matter.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The start sequence of the pearls as a string and the step number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The probability for a white pearl as a float.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task introduces you to the basics of probability theory and statistics.
    Fun fact: regardless of the initial state, as the number of steps increases, the probability approaches 0.5!
